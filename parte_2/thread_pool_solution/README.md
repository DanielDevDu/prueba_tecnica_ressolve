In this solution I use just OOP to manage data with the SimpleMnageData class

- Each File run in the same thread(with the same instance of the class)
- With SimpleManageData class we can:

  - read files with pandas or json
  - convert to Dataframe with pandas
  - save in a file with pickle
  - read dataframe from pickle file

- The Executer class is the form in we can execute the methos of the class
